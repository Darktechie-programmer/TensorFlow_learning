My Understanding:
	Module 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals :
		--> Artificial Intelligence vs Neural Networks vs Machine Learning 
		1. A.I:
			--> Def : The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by human
			--> A.I can be simple or complex.
			--> A.I. --(inside)-> M.L. --(inside)-> NN(Neural Network)
			--> A.I is nothing but just set of rules so machine can do which the human wants to doing with them ...
		2. M.L:
			--> Machine Learning figure out the rules for us... so for A.T. used.
				e.g --> [Data + Answer] --> (Machine Learning Programing) --> Genrate some rules
					--> then [Data + rules] --> (Classical Programing) --> Answer
			        So our Goal for machine learning models: Highest accuracy possible.. for better/best rules
					
			Machine Learning Summary : 
					--> Rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us.
		3. NN : 
			--> def : A form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data..
			--> Multistage information extraction process.... (inshort)
			
	--> Data about : data have two things in supervised learning 1) Feature 2) label 
	
	Types of machine Learning :
			1) Supervised Learning
			2) Unsupervised Learning
			3) Reinforcement Learning --> for me it's a best...
	
	1) Supervised Learning:
			--> Dataset have feature and label... based on feature predict the label..
			--> most of used... many of used..
			
	2) Unsupervised Learning:
			--> Dataset have only feature based on feature predict the label...
			--> many examples like using clustering based... k-mean,Heirarchy clustering etc
			
	3) Reinforcement Learning:
			--> I loved this learning.... NO data , NO Lable... using the environmant agent learning just like a child and get some rewards good and bad type..
			eg. AI games, tic-tac-toa... learning from experianced..
			
	
	Module 2: Introduction to TensorFlow :
		--> general introduction of TensorFlow..
		--> Understanding What is Tensor is?
		--> Understanding Shape and data is
		--> How tensorflow work from begin ...
